The LcdRowGraph library uses the LiquidCrystal library and the user
defineable characters (via createChar) to provide a row graph that extends
across a number of columns and can display five different levels per column.For example in a 16x2 LCD display the graph can display up to 80 different
levels (not including zero). While the code is reasonably general, it does
assume a 5x8 pixel LCD character.

To use the code you need to create an LcdRowGraph object. The constructor
take the following parameters:-

    LiquidCrystal& lcd

        A LiquidCrystal object.

    int32_t min

        The minimum value to be graphed

    int32_t max

        The maximum value to be graphed

    uint8_t row

        The display row where the graph will be drawn

    uint8_t firstColumn 
    
        The first column of the graph (default is 0)

    uint8_t lastColumn

        The last column of the graph (default is 15)

The methods are as follows:

    void value(int32_t value);

        Set the graph to 'value', scaled between min and max.

    void unscaled(uint8_t value);

        The unscaled method allows you to to set the graph to a specific
        level without using a scale between min and max. For example if the
        graph is over 16 columns the graph can have an unscaled value
        between 0 and 80.

    uint8_t getRow() const;

        Returns the row number where the graph will be displayed

    int32_t getMin() const;

        Get the minimum value that the graph is mapped to.

    int32_t getMax() const;

        Get the maximum value that the graph is mapped to.

    void setMinMax(int32_t min, int32_t max);

        Set the minimum and maximum values that the graph is mapped to.
